Map of libraries and their low-cost supporting facilities within Vancouver

This is the README file for the URST 472 Lab 2 project.

Reflective analysis :

Overall, the map focuses on representing libraries within Vancouver, enabling users on a tight budget to discover free and low-cost social resources nearby. This assists them in organizing their routes and plans around the libraries in their vicinity.

For the map interactions, when users hover over the library icon, a pop up with the name and exact location of the library will appear. If users would like to explore low-budget programs near the library, they can click on the library icon, and surrounding free or low-cost food programs, including meal services and affordable groceries within a 1-mile radius, will appear. Similarly, as users scroll through the dots, the name of the organization and a brief description of the program will appear. The icons representing free and low-cost food programs are divided into two colors: green signifies programs that provide meals, while red indicates those that do not. This information is also included in the descriptions of the programs.

To enhance users' experiences on the map, the left side also provides tools that enable users to interact with the map more effectively and customize their experiences. Users can set up their route by clicking on their current location and their destinations directly. Navigation directions will appear with estimated time of arrival and route length, along with step-by-step navigation instructions on the left side of the map. Additionally, users can choose their preferred travel methods, allowing the map to generate the most optimized path for them, enabling users to discover the best route to the libraries' closest supporting facilities such as food programs and parks. Moreover, users can search their current locations by typing in the search box at the side of the map. The map will automatically mark and zoom to those destinations, and the surrounding free or low-cost food programs will also appear for users to plan their routes accordingly.

Map critique session :

When I showed the original map to a friend, he believed that most people would use both the library and free or low-cost food programs during the daytime. Therefore, he suggested using a bright, light-colored theme for the map to better fit its presentation. Additionally, he suggested zooming in on the map slightly and scaling up the icon of the library for better recognition of the main purpose of the map. He also suggested highlighting the color of the water and parks for better visualization of the Vancouver border, and the existence of parks themselves as free social resources around the libraries
