Reflective analysis : 

The purpose of this map is to demonstrate the availability of free and low-cost food options within Vancouver, enabling users to locate themselves, understand their surroundings, and access information about nearby free and low-cost food.

The base map is designed in a dark-colored monochrome style with minimal information, allowing users to easily contrast the more important information. To enhance user experience, the locations of free and low-cost food are highlighted in a soft, low-contrast blue with white outline, drawing attention without disrupting the overall tone of the map. Meanwhile, the size of the food programmes are set to 5, allowing users to identify them even in far distances. 

To further enhance the user experience, instructions have been provided alongside the map, explaining the meaning of the icons and how to use the map effectively. When users input their locations into the search bar, the map will immediately focus on their location and drop a pin, while highlighting nearby food programs within a 1-mile radius. These programs are color-coded, with green and red indicating the food programmes provide meals or not, helping users easily identify them. The 1-mile distance limit was chosen as it is more accessible for most people either on foot or drive. 

While the food programs are highlighted, users can scroll through them, and detailed information will pop up, including the program names, organizations, detailed descriptions, and distances from the pinned locations. When users use the line tool to connect their current location with the surrounding food programs, the map will generate the most accessible driving route accordingly. The route line will be highlighted in orange, with a line width of 8 and an opacity of 0.8, ensuring contrast against the color black without disrupting the overall tone. When the route line is generated within the map, the trip duration and drive guidance with easy steps would also appear at the side of the map, allowing users to reach their destinations more easily. 

Map critique session :

When I showed the original map to a friend, he suggested that the light-colored chrome theme might be too bright, especially in dark areas like outdoors at night. He also felt that the colored zoning districts and labels lacked sufficient interaction with the food programs. To address user preferences, he recommended adding detailed information within the food program labels through pop-up displays. Additionally, he didn't see the necessity of representing latitude and longitude, given that road and street names are already present on the map. Visually, he favored the color blue because it reminded him of the 'default' states of the labels, which aren't too prominent yet still allow users to identify locations. He preferred reducing opacity to increase contrast.
